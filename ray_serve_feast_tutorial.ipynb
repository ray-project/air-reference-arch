    "Where does Ray Serve fit in the landscape of machine learning serving tools? \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, there's a spectrum of ML serving tools:\n",
    "- People typically start with either framework-specific servers (e.g. TFServing, TorchServe) or generic web-serving frameworks (e.g. Flask, FastAPI) as an easy start to deploy a single model. \n",
    "- For more \"production-readiness\", people add custom toolings (e.g. Docker, K8s, Golang-based microservices). \n",
    "- But it's tough to maintain an ad-hoc pathwork of systems that are glued together. People are starting to look for special-purpose deployment tools (e.g. KubeFlow, KServe, Triton, etc.) to manage and deploy many models in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this spectrum of tools, users face tradeoffs between ease-of-development and production scalability. However, **Ray Serve lets you easily develop locally and then transparently scale to production**, giving you the best of both worlds!\n",

    "\n",
    "Features stores are systems that store your machine learning models' input data, also known as \"features.\" Managing data pipelines for these features can be challenging. Machine learning engineers and data scientists can integrate feature stores like Feast into their pipelines to aggregate, organize, store, and serve features. This can be especially helpful when considering that features may need to be collected in real time and stored in a way that makes them useful for both online inference and offline training."
